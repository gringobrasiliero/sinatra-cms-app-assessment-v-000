This CRUD App is called Project Sharer

It is an app where you can share your Projects that you are working on with your students. It is a good way to share the big projects you are working on with your students, to give ideas to other Code Coaches.

To install, Clone this repo, and to have the Application active, you must run shotgun, and follow the link to the IP address that is listed on the command line.

As soon as you create an account and log in, you will be able to view other peoples projects that they have been working on, and you will be able to share yours!

Enjoy!
